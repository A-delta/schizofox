## About
Hey, so this configuration started as a part of my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles), but apparently people actually used it, so I decided to move it into its own flake.
Compared to other browsers/configuration I would say its pretty schizophrenic, but I use it as my daily driver, so I had to keep some sane defaults (if you really need to, just use Tor Browser).
Another cool thing is declarative theming. Just specify 3 colors and your font of choice and nix will do the rest (userChrome.css and darkreader config). 

‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: Use Ctrl+I to allow cookies for sites of your choice

Make sure to submit an issue in case anything brakes (or contribute if you know how to fix it)
